# Waltimise
Solution for the Waltimise Problem
In our method we split the dataset of 300 elements into groups of 7(except one group of 6) and then find an absolute optimum answer on each set through brute force and then add all the sets up together.
For each group, the minimum revenue and quantity for each is decided by applying the gain percentage formula on just that set alone.
Our method is computationally scalable but the hit efficiency may decrease on increasing number of items.
